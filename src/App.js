        "There's nothing quite like The Witcher 3, where one moment you can help put the soul of a noonwraith to rest and the next you can head to the Passiflora and engage in some heavy petting (that you paid for).This is the best damn RPG you can play right now, so toss a coin to your witcher, you've got the time."

      description:
        "In this sequel, BioWare takes the foundation laid in Mass Effect (Commander Shepherd must navigate space racism and the potential predetermined destruction of the universe alongside a motley crew of aliens) and builds a beautiful shiny space house on top of it."

      description:
        "League of Legends might not have been the first MOBA, but it's certainly proved to be the biggest. More accessible than DOTA 2, and with a greater focus on its characters and their personalities, it's established itself as the definitive MOBA, especially if you're just starting out."

      title: "DOTA 2",
      rating: "‚≠ê 4.8/5",
      description:
        "Technically the sequel to the proto-MOBA, Defense of the Ancients, Valve scooped up that original team and made DOTA 2 its very own. It's one of the more punishing games on this list due to the sheer depth of its mechanics, but that does at least mean it'll keep most of its fans playing for thousands of hours."

      title: "Heroes of the Storm",
      rating: "‚≠ê 4.5/5",
      description:
        "Blizzard released Heroes of the Storm back in 2015, creating a multiverse of sorts where some of the most iconic characters across franchises like Diablo, Starcraft and Overwatch joined forces together, and battled in all sorts of familiar maps and arenas completing objectives. The biggest highlight, however, lies upon the dynamic of each match."

      title: "Starcraft 2",
      rating: "‚≠ê 4.9/5",
      description:
        "Starcraft was the first taste of the RTS genre for many, and for good reason. Its gritty sci-fi aesthetic, interesting characters with solid voice acting, and of course, non-stop combat and resource management in real time made it stand out for years to come. The sequel brought much of what had worked well in its predecessor packed in a new campaign and multiplayer modes."

      description:
        "This list couldn‚Äôt miss the addition of Halo Wars, one of the most interesting RTS out there. Not just because of the fact that it‚Äôs a polished and worthy spin on the genre, but also in terms of how well it adapts everything that makes Halo so rich into uncharted territory for the franchise. You can expect the same buck wild, frantic action of Halo‚Äôs intense battles in a different perspective, leading several units at a time and looking for the best approach for every encounter."
    },
    {
      title: "Ages of Empires 2: Definitive Edition",
      rating: "‚≠ê 4.75/5",
      description:
        "It‚Äôs no wonder that after all these years Age of Empires is still one of the first recommendations that come to mind when talking about RTS games. Everything from the design to the charm (and often silliness) of the units makes it for a title that rarely misses. The Definitive Edition isn‚Äôt exactly groundbreaking in terms of changes, but it‚Äôs one of those cases where any drastic changes would have raised some brows."
